# python_scripts
A collection of small python scripts

duo_to_graphviz.py accesses the Duolingo API (https://www.duolingo.com/) to get a current list of languages on offer
and reformats the data for graphviz to produce a directed graph

scrape_your_plate.py scrapes Pepper Plate (https://www.pepperplate.com/) and saves a basic copy of all of the stored recipes
just in case it ever vanishes.
